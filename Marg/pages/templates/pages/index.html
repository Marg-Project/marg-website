            <p class="paragraph">
                "A heritage route is composed of tangible elements of which the cultural significance comes from 
                exchanges and a multi-dimensional dialogue across countries or regions, and that illustrate the 
                interaction of movement, along the route, in space and time" (UNESCO, 1994).
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The significance of "cultural routes" as one of the four categories of World Heritage sites is apparent. 
                The concept is further advanced by the ICOMOS charter on cultural routes, which offers guidance on 
                the identification, documentation, conservation, and promotion of these routes.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The charter provides a broad framework that does not take into account the significance of smaller 
                cultural routes that predominantly showcase intangible cultural assets. Additionally, the charters do 
                not clearly establish criteria for identifying and evaluating Nomadic and transhumance routes, 
                Indigenous routes that exhibit agricultural expansion, routes based on Indigenous oral knowledge 
                networks, routes that reflect Indigenous or maritime trading systems, and other similar routes. 
                (Srichandan et al., 2021).
