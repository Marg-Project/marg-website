            The project aims to create an open-source database that links all institutions, laboratories, and
            researchers engaged in the study of cultural and historic routes across the Indian Subcontinent region. As
            the first stage, the project focuses on the trade routes of the Bhotiya tribe in the Himalayan Regions.
            Within the context of the Himalayan region, the Bhotias of Uttarakhand traversed cultural routes to reach
            Tibet's highlands, which demonstrates how societies enrich themselves through communication over centuries.
            This ethnically and culturally diverse community traditionally lived a nomadic life and can be found in the
            upper reaches of the Great Himalayas, along the Indo-Tibetan border.

            The core objective of our project is to promote and preserve the cultural and heritage roots of the Indian
            Subcontinent. To create an all-encompassing resource that fosters collaboration, facilitates the sharing of
            knowledge and resources, and provides a platform for all stakeholders to come together and honor the
            region's rich and multifaceted cultural heritage.
