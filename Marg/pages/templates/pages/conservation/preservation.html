        In the context of heritage conservation, preservation pertains to properties
        that have been preserved in their largely intact form, and are representative
        of the period of significance. This includes historic roads/routes and
        related resources that have maintained their original design and materials
        in a good state of repair. The preservation approach primarily involves
        activities and measures that focus on maintenance and upkeep of such
        resources.
