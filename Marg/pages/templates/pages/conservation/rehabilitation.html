        Rehabilitation pertains to properties that, while reflecting the period of significance, may require some repair
        or alteration. This pertains to historic roads/routes and related resources that are in fair condition, or those
        that require modification for safety purposes, while maintaining their original design and materials. Under
        rehabilitation, activities and actions primarily focus on maintenance, careful handling, and limited replacement
        or modification.
