        Restoration pertains to properties that still possess significant elements from the period of historical
        significance, although they may need some degree of repair, alteration, or removal of non-contributing features.
        This primarily applies to historic roads/routes and related resources that retain their original design and
        materials. In the case of restoration, the emphasis is on maintaining and preserving the intact historic
        features, restoring lost elements, and eliminating unsuitable features, thereby enhancing the property's
        authenticity.
